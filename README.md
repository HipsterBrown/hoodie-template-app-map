# hoodie-template-app-map

A boilerplate app module, you can use to build your own application on it!

## How to start
Create a new hoodie app in your local enviroment with

````
hoodie new mapApp -t zoepage/hoodie-template-app-map
````

## Notice!
This boilerplate app is still in progress!
But you can help us to build it!

## Contribute
This is a list of things needs to be done:

- clone the hoodie-moufle
- check if the .gitignore file is update
- add leafletjs.com to the boilerplate
- hook up the map functions like save, load and edit to hoodie, so you can add, manage and save markers
- keep it simple and write comments, so everyone will understand your code
- write a small tutorial about the boilerplate


If you have any questions, please let me know!
Thank you for contributing and all the <3 from hoodie!
